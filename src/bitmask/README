     Simple and efficient bitmask collision detection routines
   Copyright (C) 2002 Ulf Ekstrom except for the bitcount function.
 
   A bitmask is a simple array of bits, which can be used for 
   2d collision detection. Set 'unoccupied' area to zero and
   occupies areas to one and use the bitmask_overlap*() functions
   to check for collisions. 

          > See bitmask.h and bitmask.c for more info. <

   The code has only been tested with gcc, but should work with 
   any recent compiler. The only thing which is compiler dependent
   is the 'inline' keyword, which is taken care of by #ifdef's.
   On some compilers you may have to remove the attribute altogether.
